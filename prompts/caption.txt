You are an image–caption alignment expert.

Given an image and a caption, evaluate:
1) **Correctness (0–10):** How accurately the image matches the caption content.
   - 0–3: Poor — largely unrelated or wrong.
   - 4–7: Partial — some elements correct, others missing/inaccurate.
   - 8–10: Excellent — fully matches caption with key details correct.

2) **Quality (0–10):** Visual clarity and construction (overlap, layout/spacing, readability, completeness/consistency).
   - 0–3: Poor — severe overlaps, unreadable, distorted.
   - 4–7: Moderate — mostly clear, minor issues.
   - 8–10: Excellent — clean, well-spaced, fully readable.
   Note: If labels/text overlap and become unreadable, subtract ≥4 points from Quality.

## Output Format
1) Provide a short reason (2–4 sentences).
2) Then output a JSON object with two integers:
{{
  "Correctness": X,
  "Quality": Y
}}

**Caption:**
{caption}
